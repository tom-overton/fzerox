# fzerox
A *very* WIP decomp of F-Zero X.

Note: To use this repository, you must already have a rom for the game.

# To use
1. Place the US F-Zero X rom into the root of the repository as "baserom.z64".
2. Make sure all python dependencies are up-to-date: `python3 -m pip install -r ./requirements.txt`
2. Set up tools and extract the rom: `make setup`
3. Re-assemble the rom: `make`
